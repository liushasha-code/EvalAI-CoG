<p>"Our evaluation criteria are derived from a formula:Score = 60 * N - T - 10 * K, N is the number of target points which is successfully activated, T is the time taken by the EP robot(the unit is seconds),  K is the collision times, if it is persistent collision, K is twice the duration of the collision.
